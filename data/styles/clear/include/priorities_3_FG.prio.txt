# FG geometry: foreground lines and areas (e.g. buildings) are rendered always below overlays
# and always on top of background geometry (BG-top & BG-by-size) even if a foreground feature
# is layer=-10 (as tunnels should be visibile over landcover and water).
#
# Priorities ranges' rendering order overview:
# - overlays (icons, captions...)
# - FG: foreground areas and lines
# - BG-top: water (linear and areal)
# - BG-by-size: landcover areas sorted by their size
