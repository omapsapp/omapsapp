On Friday, December 6, Alexander Borsuk, unilaterally and without justification revoked my rightful ownership in the GitHub organization after [I disclosed details of an incident involving the removal of the MIT license from one of the repositories](https://github.com/orgs/organicmaps/discussions/9837). This action, and the fact that my access was removed, were confirmed both by GitHub and by Alexander Borsuk himself (see screenshots attached).

---------

I would like to remind Alexander Borsuk, a co-founder of MAPS.ME, that this project is called **Organic Maps**, not **MAPS.ME**, which he may mistakenly believe he is still working on as one of the owners. Additionally, I want to inform Mr. Borsuk that Organic Maps had adopted the [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) on the very first day of its creation. I acknowledge that Alexander Borsuk may not be aware of the Code of Conduct, as this policy was implemented months before Alexander Borsuk even appeared on the horizon of the Organic Maps project. 

**Retaliating against someone for reporting an incident or providing information as a witness is a blatant and egregious violation of the Code of Conduct.** A subsequent attempt to coerce or blackmail me into accepting his terms goes beyond a violation of the Code of Conduct. The retroactive alteration of the code license could potentially conflict with civil law, but it is not my authority to make that determination.

Such behavior must be addressed to uphold the integrity of this project and its community. It represents an attack on the principles of transparency, accountability, and the collaborative spirit of open-source development that Organic Maps was founded upon.
