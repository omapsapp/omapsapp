# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Organic Maps!

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute.

### Donate

See https://organicmaps.app/donate/

### Bug Reports

The simplest way to contribute is to [submit an issue](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues).
Please give developers as much information as possible: OS and application versions,
list of actions leading to a bug, a log file produced by the app.

When using the Organic Maps app on a device, use the built-in "Report a bug" option:
it creates a new e-mail with a log file attached. Your issue will be processed much
faster if you send it to bugs@organicmaps.app.

### Feature Requests

If you have some ideas or want to request a new feature, please [start a discussion thread](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/discussions/categories/ideas).

### Translations

If you want to improve app translations or add more search synonyms, please update [strings.txt](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/data/strings/strings.txt) file, run `./tools/unix/generate_localizations.sh` and create a [Pull Request](#pull-requests).

Use `./tools/python/strings/google_translate.py` to generate initial strings for all languages:

```bash
cd tools/python/strings
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
./google_translate.py "Hello"
```

### Code Contributions

## Process

### Pull Requests

Each pull request is reviewed by OMaps maintainers, to ensure consistent code style
