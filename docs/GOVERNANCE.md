# Governance

The Organic Maps is led by contributors from across the community. Different functional domains may periodically establish, develop, or dissolve their own leadership structures, whether formal or informal. As an open-source initiative, we enthusiastically welcome fresh contributors to identify challenges, propose solutions, and engage in collaborative efforts to drive progress. Our community recognizes and empowers able leaders from among our peers. Community members are always encouraged to get involved in leading Organic Maps in ways that are important to them, while minimizing overhead and governance project-wide.

The following functional project structure has evolved over time:
