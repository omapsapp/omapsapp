# Communication

Organic Maps is a mobile app for end-users, developed by the community. While some end-users may become contributors, and contributors obviously use the product, these roles typically represent separate areas of involvement. Separate communication channels are available for individuals seeking assistance with using the application and for those seeking help with contributions.

## Issues with the App

The preferred method for reporting an issue with the app is to file a GitHub Issue that clearly details the problem, including any relevant information or steps to reproduce the issue. This ensures that the issue is properly tracked and addressed by the team. If you encounter any difficulties using GitHub or need assistance with submitting the issue, please send a free-form email to support@organicmaps.app. The team will assist with triaging the issue and help guide you through the process.

Channels in order of preference:

1. [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/)
2. [Email](mailto:support@organicmaps.app)

## Issues with Development

The preferred method for reporting a development issue is to file a GitHub Issue that clearly details the problem, including any relevant information or steps to reproduce the issue. This ensures that the issue is properly tracked and addressed by the team. If you are having trouble formulating the problem or providing sufficient details, please consider seeking help in the project’s communication channels, such as the community chat, where you can collaborate with other contributors or team members. This will help clarify the issue before submitting a GitHub Issue, ensuring that all necessary information is included for a more efficient resolution.

Channels in order of preference:

1. [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/)
2. [Zulip Workspace](https://organicmaps.zulipchat.com)

## Feature Proposals

The preferred method for submitting a feature proposal is to file a GitHub Issue that clearly outlines the proposed feature, its potential benefits, and any relevant context or use cases. This allows the team to review the suggestion and track its progress. When submitting a feature proposal, please provide as much detail as possible, including mockups, user stories, or examples that can help others understand the concept and its potential impact.

If you're unsure how to present the proposal or need feedback before submitting, consider discussing it in the project’s communication channels, such as the community chat or forums. This will give you the opportunity to refine your idea based on input from other contributors or team members. Please note that proposals without a filed ticket will have little to no chance of being processed.
