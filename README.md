## Translations

If you want to improve app translations or add more search synonyms, please check our [wiki](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/wiki).

## Compilation

To compile the project, you would need to initialize private key files. Run
`configure.sh` and press Enter to create empty files, good enough to build desktop
and Android debug packages.

For detailed installation instructions and Android/iOS building process,
see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/tree/master/docs/INSTALL.md).

## Building maps

To create one or many map files, first build the project, then use python module [maps_generator](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/tree/master/tools/python/maps_generator).

## Map styles

OMaps uses its own binary format for map styles, `drules_proto.bin`, which is compiled from
[MapCSS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS) using modified Kothic library.
Feature set in MWM files depends on a compiled style, so make sure to rebuild maps after
releasing a style.

For development, use OMaps Designer app along with its generator tool: these allow
for quick rebuilding of a style and symbols, and for producing a zoom-independent
feature set in MWM files.

See [STYLES.md](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/tree/master/docs/STYLES.md) for the
format description, instructions on building a style and some links.

## Development

You would need Qt 5 for development, most other libraries are included into the
repository: see `3party` directory. The team uses mostly XCode and Qt Creator,
though these are not mandatory. We have an established
[c++ coding style](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/CPP_STYLE.md) and [Objective-C coding style](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/OBJC_STYLE.md).

**You can turn on experimental public transport support.** For details please read [simple instruction.](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/EXPERIMENTAL_PUBLIC_TRANSPORT_SUPPORT.md)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the repository initialization process, the description of all the directories
of this repository and other development-related information.
